# Project BiSheng

### About

I want to create a personal blog by using a static site generator and I want to practice my C++ skills. Therefore I started this project. The basic idea is to convert markdown files to html pages, then create a static web site from these html pages.

*Bi Sheng(毕昇)* was a Chinese artisan who invented the world's first movable type technology, so I thought this should be a good name for this project.

See wikipedia for more information about [Bi Sheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng).
